			      Custom Built-in HOWTO
			      =====================


Overview
========
To create and use a custom built-in predicate there are only a few steps to follow:

* Extend one of the built-in base classes (AbstractBuiltin, ArithmeticBuiltin, BooleanBuiltin)
* Register the built-in with the BuiltinRegister class


Extend one of the base classes
==============================
Take a look at the FahrenheitToCelsiusBuiltin.java in this directory.
You also might want to read the javadoc of the BuiltinRegister. There are only 3
things you must to implement:

* a constructor taking an ITerm array as input which might then be the constants
  and variables set in this built-in.
* implement either:
  * AbstractBuiltin.evaluateTerms( ITerm[] terms, int[] variableIndexes ), OR
  * BooleanBuiltin.computeResult( ITerm[] terms ), OR
  * ArithmeticBuiltin.computeMissingTerm( int missingTermIndex, ITerm[] terms )
* provide a static getBuiltinPredicate() method which returns the predicate object
  describing your built-in (with attributes 'name' and 'arity')

Note: The BuiltinHelper class has some useful utility methods you might want to use.


Register the built-in
=====================
There are two ways to register a built-in:
* automatically by adding the class name to the 'builtins.load' load file
* explicitly by calling the BuiltinRegister.registerBuiltin( Class ) 


Automatically
-------------
You only have to write the classname of your built-in in the builtins.load file
and make this file accessible through the classpath (note: only one
builtins.load file will be recognised). In the builtins.load file you must list all
the built-in classes that you want loaded automatically. Place one fully qualified class name
on each line of the file.


Explicitly
----------
Call BuiltinRegister.registerBuiltin( Class ) with your built-in class's class object as the parameter,
e.g. <IProgram object>.getBuiltinRegister().registerBuiltin(FahrenheitToCelsiusBuiltin.class);


Use the Built-in
================
The built-in should now be recognised when you evaluate a logic program. Note that the built-in must
be explicitly registered for every program object.
