1815048 Allow predicate names to have underscores and digits.
1814418 toString() for some terms types is too verbose.

Changes for release 0.4
=======================

New features

1773182 Add subtraction builtin for dateTime
	
Bug fixes
1716628 MiscOps.statify(...) method is broken

Known problems
--------------
1798276 Magic Sets evaluation does not allow conjunctive queries. (This will
        will be fixed for the next release.)
	

Changes for release 0.3
=======================
	Additions:
	----------
	- Support for all data types supported by WSML
	- A number of built-ins implemented
	- The evaluation modified to properly handle built-ins.
	- added the IMixedDatatypeRelation  and corresponding implementations
	- added the IndexingOnTheFlyRelation and corresponding implementations
	- Relational algebra operators modified to handle IMixedDatatypeRelation
	- Added the IRelationFactory interface (not all calls 
	  to the Relation constructor are exchanged, yet)
	- modified the IBuiltinInterface
	- reimplemented the Complementor class (used for the construction 
	  of the DOM)
	- modified the parser to distinguish the datatypes (according 
	  to the wsml datatype specification)
	- added the ITime interface, including the implementation, and so on...
	
	Fixes:
	------
	- added the possibility to make custom builitns (see doc folder for a
	  howto)
	- added relations to accept tuples with various datatypes at any
	  position
	- some bugfixes in the magic sets
	- some bugfixes in the Join operator and SeminaiveEvaluation classes
