1815048  	Allow predicate names to have underscores and digits.
1814418  	toString() for some terms types is too verbose.
1812121 	Revise safe-rule checks.

Changes since 0.3:
==================

	New features
	------------
	1773193 - IRIS is now able to persist facts in a relational database
	1773182 - Add subtraction builtin for dateTime
	
	Bug fixes
	---------
	1716628 - MiscOps.statify(...) method is broken
	1749168 - satisfiability checks broken
	1778705 - it is possible to specify inconsistent timezones
	1780055 - Duration should hold the timespan in millis
	1792385 - DateTime datatype handles months incorrectly
	1792822 - Exceptionally long evaluation time
	
	Known problems
	--------------
	1798276 - Magic Sets evaluation does not allow conjunctive queries. (This will
	          will be fixed for the next release.)
	

Changes since 0.2:
==================
	Additions:
	----------
	- Support for all data types supported by WSML
	- A number of built-ins implemented
	- The evaluation modified to properly handle built-ins.
	- added the IMixedDatatypeRelation  and corresponding implementations
	- added the IndexingOnTheFlyRelation and corresponding implementations
	- Relational algebra operators modified to handle IMixedDatatypeRelation
	- Added the IRelationFactory interface (not all calls 
	  to the Relation constructor are exchanged, yet)
	- modified the IBuiltinInterface
	- reimplemented the Complementor class (used for the construction 
	  of the DOM)
	- modified the parser to distinguish the datatypes (according 
	  to the wsml datatype specification)
	- added the ITime interface, including the implementation, and so on...
	
	Fixes:
	------
	- added the possibility to make custom builitns (see doc folder for a
	  howto)
	- added relations to accept tuples with various datatypes at any
	  position
	- some bugfixes in the magic sets
	- some bugfixes in the Join operator and SeminaiveEvaluation classes
