			      Custom Builtin HOWTO
			      ====================

Overview:
=========
To create and use a custom builtin there are only a view steps neccessary:
* Extend the AbstractBuiltin
* Register the builtin in the BuiltinRegister of the program
* use the builtin ;)

Extend the AbstractBuiltin:
===========================
Take a look at the FahrenheitToCelsiusBuiltin.java in this directory.
You also might want to read the javadoc of the BuiltinRegister. There are only 3
things you hava to implement:
* a constructor taking an ITerm array as input which might then be the constants
  and variables set in this builtin.
* implement the evaluate(Collection<ITuple>) method for your needs (the
  BuiltinHelper got some methods, you might want to use.
* provide a staitc getBuiltinPredicate() method which returns the predicate
  describing your builtin (the arity and the predicate name)

Register the builtin:
=====================
There are two ways to register a builtin:
* automatically through the builtins.load file
* by hand, calling the registerBuiltin(Class) method of the BuiltinRegister

Automatically:
--------------
You only have to write the classname of your builtin in the builtins.load file
and make this file accessible through the classpath (note: only one
builtins.load file will be recognized). In the builtins.load you list all
builtins, you want to load at the creatinon of the BuiltinRegister. On each line
of the file there must only one classname be listed.

By hand:
--------
Call the registerBuiltin(Class) method with your builtin class as parameter.
E.g.: <IProgram object>.getBuiltinRegister().registerBuiltin(FahrenheitToCelsiusBuiltin.class)

Use the Builtin:
================
The builtin should now be recognized as such, when you parse a datalog program
using the sablecc parser (if you use the program where you registered the
builtin as parameter, too ;) )

Notes:
======
If you find any bugs, pleas don't hesitate to report them, using the bugtracher
